		<li>Routing: Removed CRUD Synonyms-- now you must explicitly use find, findAll, create, destroy, update (can't use <code>get</code>, <code>detail</code>, <code>delete</code>, <code>edit</code>, etc. to indicate the same thing. Turns out this was actually annoying, not helpful)</li>
		<li>Routing: Fix in API blueprint for regression around PUT/DELETE automatic RESTful routes</li>
		<li>Routing: Fix for resourceful routing. /model/[id] didn't work with verbs. It now does.</li>
		<li>Config: _ and async no longer have to be global (but they are by default) They are configurable with <code>sails.config.globals._</code> and <code>sails.config.globals.async</code> (thanks <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/particlebanana">@particlebanana</a>!)</li>
		<li>New sails project can now be created in the current dir with <code>sails new .</code> (thanks <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/collinwren">@collinwren</a>!)</li>
